## Coding Experience

### MyRecovery August 2015 - May 2017

MyRecovery is a MedTech startup that builds apps that act as a digital companion for orthopaedic surgery. 

I was the first developer hired at MyRecovery, I worked closely with the CTO to build the first version of the app which was cross platform and built using Ionic, Angular 1, html and css. The first version of the app was shipped to both iOS and Android devices and was successfully trialled at hospitals throughout the UK. As Google were working on a major upgrade to Angular it was decided that we wanted to be early adopters and move away from Angular 1 to Angular 2 instead - I lead on this rebuild of the app.

After more successful trials we received seed funding, this enabled us to expand the team and bring in more roles and specialisms . We hired a new CTO who had a lot of industry experience building mobile apps and also had worked on large health apps such as Touch Surgery. It was decided that in order to most easily harness devices' capabilities it would be necessary to re-wright the apps natively using Swift and Java. I worked very closely with him during this re-write and then left in May 2017 after the successful completion of both of the native apps.

MyRecovery is a data driven startup. It works on the collection and integration of healthcare data. I worked with the data science team to ensure high data quality, compliance with Legislation in the UK and US including HIPPA and the UK data protection act as well as implementing system best practices for information governance. I worked to integrate it with the wider MedTech ecosystem including Apple HeathKit, Google Fit and Open mHealth.  

At MyRecovery we practiced an agile work flow. With 2 week sprints and monthly retrospectives. I was responsible for introducing test driven development to the mobile projects. I also worked with the backend developers to introduce TDD on their projects as well.
